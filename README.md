# Manhattan-Distance

Manhattan distance is a distance metric between two points in a N dimensional vector space. It is the sum of the lengths of the projections of the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes. In simple terms, it is the sum of absolute difference between the measures in all dimensions of two points.

# Formula for calculate this Manhattan Distance 
|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = Manhattan Distance
